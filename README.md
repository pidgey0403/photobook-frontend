# Photobook ðŸ“¸

Photobook is a collaborative online photo album containing our most unforgettable memories of 2022. Designed to be a throwback of our best moments, think of Photobook as a ![Spotify Wrapped](https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/wrapped/) for photographic captures throughout the year!

## Motivation

Photobook was built to share your favourite memories with close friends and family, on a centralized, easy-to-use website. Physical albums are great for storing large collections of family photos, but can easily get cumbersome and tedious to carry around. With Photobook it is easy to store and share your favourite photos and celebrate those special moments with your loved ones, or even just something cool you enjoyed!

## Running the App Locally
Run the command:

```bash
$ pnpm start:dev

```
This should run the App in development mode and expose port 3000. Visit `http://localhost:3000/` to start playing with the App locally.
